## üìù Project Overview

This project performs a comprehensive risk analysis on a dataset of **3,000 banking clients**. The primary objective is to identify factors that contribute to a client's risk profile, enabling the bank to make smarter, data-driven lending decisions. The analysis leverages a multi-tool approach to demonstrate a full-cycle data workflow, from raw data processing to business intelligence.

## ‚ú® Key Features & Insights

* **Risk Indicator Identification:** Pinpointed that **loan size** is the most significant predictor of risk, with high-risk clients holding loan balances nearly **200% larger** than low-risk clients.
* **Customer Segmentation:** Revealed that client occupation is a key demographic for segmentation. For example, clients in engineering roles were found to be over **65% more likely** to be in low-risk categories.
* **Risk Concentration Analysis:** The interactive dashboard highlights that the top **5%** of borrowers account for over **15%** of the bank's total loan exposure.
* **Interactive Dashboard:** A user-friendly Power BI dashboard allows non-technical stakeholders to filter and explore the client data to understand risk profiles dynamically.

## üöÄ Tech Stack

* **Data Analysis:** Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
* **Database:** MySQL
* **Business Intelligence & Visualization:** Power BI
* **Development Environment:** Jupyter Notebook

## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Workflow

The project was executed in three distinct phases:

1.  **Discovery & Analysis (Python):** Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in a Jupyter Notebook to clean the data, visualize distributions, and calculate the core statistical insights.
2.  **Structuring & Storing (MySQL):** Designed a relational database schema and ingested the cleaned data into a MySQL database to simulate a scalable, real-world production environment.
3.  **Visualization & Communication (Power BI):** Connected Power BI to the MySQL database to build an interactive dashboard, translating complex data into actionable business intelligence.
